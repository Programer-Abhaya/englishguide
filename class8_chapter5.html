          = I don't like her because the old woman constant greed and desire for
          power.The old
          couple’s desire for more and more led to their downfall, losing
          everything they had gained from the lime tree. It reminds us to
          appreciate what we have and not to let greed cloud our judgment. -The
          story teaches us the consequences of greed and the importance of being
          content with what we have. D. What would you do if you were the old
          woman? Discuss. If I were the old woman in the story, I would have
          been happy with what the lime tree gave us. I would have appreciated
          the horse and cart, the new hut, and all the animals we received. I
          would have enjoyed our newfound happiness and not asked for more. I
          would have learned that it’s important to be content with what we
          have. Sometimes, wanting too much can lead to trouble. The old woman
          in the story kept asking for more and more, and in the end, everything
          was lost. It teaches us the lesson of being grateful and appreciating
          u'0f dfGg' the blessings we already have, rather than always wanting
          more.
