            <h2>f. Why do you think it is important to celebrate Parents’ Day?</h2>
            <p>Parents Day is important because it provides an opportunity for us to express our gratitude and
                appreciation towards our parents. Our parents take care of us, support us, and love us unconditionally
                throughout our lives. By celebrating Parents Day, we can take a moment to thank them for their selfless
                efforts and let them know how much we value them. It’s a special occasion to recognize their hard work,
                sacrifices, and the vital role they play in shaping our lives. Moreover, celebrating Parents Day allows
                us to strengthen the bond between parents and children, fostering a deeper connection and creating
                cherished memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
